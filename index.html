            I have been playing cello for nine years, through that time I have played for
            various events: award ceremonies, fashion shows, community events. This is a
            path I have curated through practicing my "talent" and putting dedication to the
            art. My message has changed as I learn more about Native American history, my
            Dine culture, and myself introspectively. I am intentional when I wear my
            traditional regalia and when I play the contemporary art form of cello. This is to
            show the resilience and emmpathy I have gained throughout the years, that I have
            put myself in between both worlds of western and indigenous culture, to share
            something beautiful. Before colonization, to the early 19th century and too now
            i am practicing art forms that are generations far from their origin. My gift
            is to present them to an audience. Listening to live music has us ground ourselves
            with our current position in our lives, where we make meaning of art. It's
            resilient, so I play resilient, as an indigenous cellist.
